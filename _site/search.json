What trends do you notice?\nAnswer: Titanic is one of the most popular movie release in 1997. the most use name in the movie is jack. We noticed that the use of the name Jack was dropping from 1940 to 1980 and started growing fromn 1990. The movie was released in 1997 and the use of the name was still increasing. Meaning, the realease of the movie didn’t impact a lot the used of the name Jack.\n\n\nShow the code\njacktable = nameData.query('name == \"Jack\"')\njacktable\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        jacktable,\n        aes(x='year', y='Total')\n    )\n    + geom_line(aes(color='name'), binwidth=10)\n    + geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=\"dashed\", color=\"blue\")\n    + labs(\n        title=\"The Impact of the Release of Titanic on the Use of the name Jack\",\n        subtitle=\"The highest Peak of the use of the name Jack was around 1930\",\n        x=\"Year\",\n        y=\"Total use\",\n        caption=\"Dashed blue line represents the release of Titanic in 1997\",\n        color=\"Total Use of the name:\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,920\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,940\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,960\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,980\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                2,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                2,020\n              \n            \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                4,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                6,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                8,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                10,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                12,000\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The Impact of the Release of Titanic on the Use of the name Jack\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The highest Peak of the use of the name Jack was around 1930\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Total use\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Year\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Total Use of the name:\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Jack\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Dashed blue line represents the release of Titanic in 1997\n      \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nSTRECH|TASK 5\nQ: Reproduce the chart Elliot using the data from the names_year.csv file\n\n\nShow the code\nelliottable = nameData.query('name == \"Elliot\"')\nelliottable\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        elliottable,\n        aes(x='year', y='Total')\n    )\n    + geom_line(aes(color='name'), binwidth=10)\n    + geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=\"dashed\", color=\"blue\")\n    + labs(\n        title=\"Elliot...

It answers the question: Of all the instances that the model predicted as positive, how many are actually positive?(Here we have 93% precision). Finally, I used the recall metric.

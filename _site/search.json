What ages would you not guess?\nANSWER2: If I talk to someone named Brittany, I will guess that He/she was born in the 90s. She is between 34 and 44 years old. But I will not guess that He/she is 60. This can be ullustrated by the chart below. We can see that the name Brittany was mostly used between 90s and never before 1980\n\n\nplot example\n# Include and execute your code here\n\nbritttanytable = nameData.query('name == \"Brittany\"')\nbritttanytable\n\n(\n  ggplot(\n    britttanytable,\n    aes(x='year', y = 'Total')\n  )\n  +geom_line(aes(color = 'name'))\n  +labs(\n    title = \"Most people named Brittany were born between 1980 and 2002\",\n    subtitle  = \"About 2.5% of the time, the name name Brittany was used after 2002\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y= \"Total use\",\n    color = \"Total Use of the name:\"\n\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,970\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,980\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,990\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                2,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                2,010\n              \n            \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                5,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                10,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                15,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                20,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                25,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                30,000\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Most people named Brittany were born between 1980 and 2002\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        About 2.5% of the time, the name name Brittany was used after 2002\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Total use\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Year\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Total Use of the name:\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Brittany\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\nMy useless chart",

From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names in a single chart. What trends do you notice?\nAnswer: Titanic is one of the most popular movie release in 1997. the most use name in the movie is jack. We noticed that the use of the name Jack was dropping from 1940 to 1980 and started growing fromn 1990. The movie was released in 1997 and the use of the name was still increasing. Meaning, the realease of the movie didn’t impact a lot the used of the name Jack.\n\n\nShow the code\njacktable = nameData.query('name == \"Jack\"')\njacktable\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        jacktable,\n        aes(x='year', y='Total')\n    )\n    + geom_line(aes(color='name'), binwidth=10)\n    + geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=\"dashed\", color=\"blue\")\n    + labs(\n        title=\"The Impact of the Release of Titanic on the Use of the name Jack\",\n        subtitle=\"The highest Peak of the use of the name Jack was around 1930\",\n        x=\"Year\",\n        y=\"Total use\",\n        caption=\"Dashed blue line represents the release of Titanic in 1997\",\n        color=\"Total Use of the name:\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,920\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,940\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,960\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                1,980\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                2,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                2,020\n              \n            \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                4,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                6,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                8,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                10,000\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                12,000\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The Impact of the Release of Titanic on the Use of the name Jack\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The highest Peak of the use of the name Jack was around 1930\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Total use\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Year\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Total Use of the name:\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Jack\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Dashed blue line represents the release of Titanic in 1997\n      \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nSTRECH|TASK 5\nQ: Reproduce the chart Elliot using the data from the names_year.csv file\n\n\nShow the code\nelliottable = nameData.query('name == \"Elliot\"')\nelliottable\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        elliottable,\n        aes(x='year', y='Total')\n    )\n    + geom_line(aes(color='name'), binwidth=10)\n    + geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=\"dashed\", color=\"blue\")\n    + labs(\n        title=\"Elliot...
